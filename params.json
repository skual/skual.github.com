{"tagline":"A new open source database management system","body":"Skual is a new database management system completey open source optimized to serve any kind of databases with any kind of server.\r\n\r\nBy default, Skual comes with a python server that can be run locally or publicly, but it's architecture is completely independant between the client (frontend) and the server (backend).\r\nDoing so, anyone can write a backend in their language of choice, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc, simply by using the API documentation.\r\n\r\nThe frontend is build using great open source tools like\r\n\r\n* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) ([See Twitter Bootstrap on Github](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap)) for the interface\r\n* [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) ([See CodeMirror on Github](https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror)) for the SQL queries\r\n* [jsTree](http://www.jstree.com) ([See jsTree on Github](https://github.com/vakata/jstree)) for the database tree\r\n* and many other.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create your own backend server for Skual, you just have to read the API (to be written ;)), which will drive the behavior of the frontend.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
